## Clustering Results Summary

We performed KMeans clustering on 1,061,768 users using both behavioral features (impressions, clicks, CTR) and demographic attributes (age level, consumption level, shopping depth, occupation, city tier). After preprocessing (log transform, clipping, handling missing values, and scaling), the model grouped users into 5 clusters:

#### Cluster distribution

Cluster 0 → 315,742 users

Cluster 1 → 84,457 users

Cluster 2 → 173,440 users

Cluster 3 → 285,120 users

Cluster 4 → 203,009 users

#### Key observations

Balanced segmentation: The clusters are relatively balanced in size, with no extreme minority cluster, which indicates the model produced meaningful splits.

Cluster diversity:

Some clusters are dominated by silent users with many impressions but no clicks.

Others represent high-value users with relatively few impressions but very high CTR.

Mid-sized clusters show active users with steady engagement.

A large group of potential churners shows high exposure but very low CTR.

Business implications:

Cluster 1 (High-CTR group) → Target for retention and personalized offers.

Cluster 0 & 3 (Silent/Inactive groups) → Consider re-engagement campaigns or reduce budget allocation.

Cluster 2 & 4 (Moderate/Exposed groups) → Optimize ad frequency and creative rotation to improve CTR.
